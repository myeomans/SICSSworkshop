library(tidyverse) # Contains MANY useful functions
library(quanteda)  # many useful text analysis tools
library(politeness) # structural features from text
library(doc2concrete) # Contains the ngramTokens function - mostly a wrapper around quanteda tools
library(glmnet) # A simple machine learning model (the LASSO)
library(ggrepel) # useful for plotting later on
library(stm)  # High-performance topic modelling
library(syuzhet) # a benchmark for sentiment detection
library(sentimentr) # a benchmark for sentiment detection
library(doMC) # to speed up some code with parallel processing

##################### Notes for Project Ideas 
#
#
## Main Effects
# Do features of reviews differ by restaurant type?
#   (price range, kid friendly, hipster, casual, trendy, breakfastâ€¦)
# 
## Interaction Effects
# Do different features predict star ratings within different restaurant types?
#
