Like when it would try to present someone as an innocent victim of the police to create an outrage, but then if you really look into it, you find other sources that shed more light on the same incident, and sometimes that light isn't very favorable to the ""victim"", ie maybe the victim was a career criminal who got caught red-handed and assaulted and endangered police and civilian lives and the shooting was justified, etc. There's a lot of stuff the media won't tell you and a lot of people who trust the media too much to shape the mindset on things and get overly outraged when they shouldn't, and also a vast majority of people who take the media's often biased reports with a grain of sand and look deeper into reports, who don't get outraged, yet you see their comments on every news article linking sources with more helpful and well-rounded information about the incident.
